#### Warning
Lots of code are taken from https://github.com/Druaga1/DankOS/
Huge thanks and credit to the Echidna Development Team (today, the people who *worked* on Dank OS).
My goal wasn't to copy them in nontheless, but a lot of the code
here (even the style of the OS itself) is really similar to it.
Anyways, i hope more stuff will be comming soonâ„¢, like file and memory managements etc.
